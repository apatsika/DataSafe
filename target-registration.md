# Register an On-premise Target Database

### Step 1: Create a Service Account for Data Safe

Before we register our database let create a Data Safe service account in our on-premise database.

1. Log in to your target database with an account that lets you create a user.
2. Create a user account with minimal privileges, for example:

```
CREATE USER DATASAFE_ADMIN identified by password
DEFAULT TABLESPACE "DATA"
TEMPORARY TABLESPACE "TEMP";
GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO DATASAFE_ADMIN;
```

- Replace `DATASAFE_ADMIN` and password with your own values.
- Do not use `SYSTEM` or `SYSAUX` as the default tablespace. You cannot mask data if you use these tablespaces.

### Step 2. Grant Roles to the Service Account

### Step 2: Register an On-Premises Oracle Database

1. Sign in to the Oracle Data Safe Console.
2. Click the **Targets** tab.
3. Click **Register**. The **Register Target** dialog box is displayed.
4. Enter a name for your on-premises Oracle database. This name can be any name you want, and all characters are accepted. The maximum number of characters is 512.
This name appears in all of the Oracle Data Safe reports that pertain to your target database.
5. For target type, select Oracle On-Premises Database.
6. (Optional) Enter a description for your target database.
7. Select the compartment to which you want your target database to belong.
You can add a target database to only one compartment and you cannot change the compartment after the target database is registered.

8. From the **Connection Type** drop-down list, select **On-Premises Connector**.
9. From the **On-Premises Connector** drop-down list, select the name of the on-premises connector that you created in the Oracle Data Safe service in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
10. From the drop-down menu, select **TCP**.

11. For **Hostname/IP Address**, enter the host name or IP address of your on-premises Oracle database.
12. For **Port Number**, enter the port number of your on-premises Oracle database.
13. For **Database Service Name**, enter the long-form service name of your on-premises Oracle database.
Enter the database user name and password that you created on your on-premises Oracle database specifically for theOracle Data Safe service.
14. If you created the user without quotation marks, you need to enter the user name in uppercase here. For example, if the user name on the target database is called test, then you need to enter TEST.
You cannot specify database roles, such as `SYSDBA` or `SYSKM`, and you cannot specify SYS as the user.
15. (Optional) To verify that Oracle Data Safe can successfully connect to your on-premises Oracle database, click **Test Connection**.
Click **Register Target**.
15. You cannot register the target database if the connection test fails or if the on-premises Oracle database does not exist.
